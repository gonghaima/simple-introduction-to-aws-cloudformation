# A Simple Introduction to AWS CloudFormation Part 3: Updating a Stack

In the last 2 stories, we created an EC2 instance and a Route53 record successfully with CloudFormation. We have yet to walk through the useful update-stack command though. In this post, weâ€™ll use the 2 templates created in the first 2 posts to play around with the update-stack command.

NOTE: All the source code for this post is available on Github:
